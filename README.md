# srplife_theme

Theme for my Ghost blog at [srp.life](https://srp.life).

## What is it?

Well, funny story. It all starts with an open-source Ghost theme called [Prometheus](https://github.com/halfrost/Prometheus). Turns out, Envato has a lot of grifters, and I purchased a very minimally modified version of this theme without any adherence to halfrost's MIT license. Sure, could they repackage it and sell it? Absolutely. Yet, they couldn't even do the bare minimum of attributing halfrost for their work.

So, in a similar spirit, I've made ample modifications to the theme to support my needs and purge out excess. As a result, I'm open-sourcing my theme, recognizing the effort of halfrost and aligning it back to its open source intentions.
